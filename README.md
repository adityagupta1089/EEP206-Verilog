# EEP206-Verilog
This repository contains IIT Ropar's EEP206 - Digital Circuits Laboratory's Verilog Codes for various circuits.

# Instructions
For running these you can use the Icarus Verilog compiler (`iverilog`), After installing compile:
```
iverilog -o and_out and_test.v and.v
```
and run usingIcarus Verilog runtime engine(`vvp`)
```
vvp and_out
```
